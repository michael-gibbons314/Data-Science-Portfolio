EveIndyAnalysis - This project is looking at market data in the videogame EVE Online, which is known for having a complex open market and manufacturing system. The project analyses the costs required to produce items, and the sell values at the main trade hub in the game. The end result is a list of items that I can manufacture in the game with the margins trading them. I discovered that many items I produce have very small margins when all costs are considered.
